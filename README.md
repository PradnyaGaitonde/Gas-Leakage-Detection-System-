# Gas-Leakage-Detection-System-
Overview:
This project implements a gas leakage detection system using Arduino. The system detects the presence of gas using gas sensors and alerts the user through a buzzer and an LED.

Features:
1.Detects various gases using gas sensors.
2.Provides visual and audible alerts upon gas detection.
3.Arduino-based, making it easy to build and modify.

Hardware Requirements
1.Arduino Uno board
2.Gas sensor
3.Piezo Buzzer
4.LED
5.Resistors
